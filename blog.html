      <h2>Who is Lionel Messi?</h2>
      <p class="intro">
        Messi, born and raised in Argentina, displayed
        innate talent for playing football early on. Messi
        began his footballing career when he was only 8 years
        old with a local soccer club named <a href="https://www.newellsoldboys.com.ar">
        Newell's Old Boys</a>.
        He continued to play with Newell's old boys for 5 years, quickly
        ascending the ranks, and enventually getting noticed by top
        soccer clubs. He eventually got recruited in the year 2000, at the
        age of 13 years, by <a href="https://www.fcbarcelona.com/">FC Barcelona</a>; one of the worlds best soccer
        clubs at that time and still to this day. Messi thus continued his
        footballing career overseas in Spain.
      </p>

      <p>
        Messi joined Barca's under 14s academy and began progressing through
        Barcelona's ranks at an astonishing rate, Climbing thought Barca C,
        Barca B, and the first team in record time. He made his first
        team debut in a friendly match at the age of 16! He appeared in his
        first official match when he was 17 years old and became a rugular
        feature of Barca's first team squad afterwards.

    <section id="strugles">
      <h2>Physical Struggles</h2>
      <p class="intro">
        Born with what seems to be god given football skills, messi had a
        growth defect during his early career. Messi was shorter and weaker
        than the rest of the players around him, but what he lacked in
        physicality he made up in pure raw talent. Tought treatment was
        available, it would cost upwards of $900 per month for 2 years, a cost
        that he couldn't afford. It wasn't until Barcelona recruited him
        that he underwent growth hormone treatment. Barcelona took
        a gamble on him by investing so much money on Messi, but in retrospect
        it was definatly worth it.

    <section id="shooting">
      <h2>Shooting Accuracy</h2>
      <p class="arguments">
        Messi's average shot attempt has a .182 chance of being goal, making
        him the 9th most efficient shooter in the sport. However, when taking
        shot volume into consideration, he is the top most efficient
        shooter of anyone with a similar shot volume to goal ratio.

    <section id="passing">
      <h2>Passing</h2>
      <p class="arguments">
        Messi is proficient at short and long passes. Coming from FC Barcelona's
        academy, it comes to no suprise that he is superb at one touch passing
        due to Barcelona's tiki-taka style of play. What many people over look
        is his long passes and vision. He is able to make a pass where one
        doesn't seem to exist or impossible to make. Some people even say that
        he has eye's behind his head or a sixth sense.

    <section id="speed">
      <h2>Speed</h2>
      <p class="arguments">
        Thanks to his speed, Messi is able to shake off defenders with ease.
        He is able to accelarate to 19.3 mph in 2.3 seconds while dribbling.
        Messi makes use of this ability by decelerating and quickly
        accelarating during a dribble to leave oponents behind.

    <section id="freekick">
      <h2>Free Kicks</h2>
        <p class="arguments">
          Messi made himself into the world's most dangerous free kick takers.
          He was not always good at free kicks, but over the past couple of years
          he has proved himself to be among the top. He scores about 8% of the
          time, compared to all player's average of 5%.

    <section id="sportsmanship">
      <h2>Fair Play</h2>
      <p class="arguments">
        Messi doesn't dive like most players and continues to play even when
        fouled. You rarely see Messi diving. Honesty is Messi's style of play.

    <section id="dribbling">
      <h2>Unparalled Dribbling Skills</h2>
      <p class="arguments">
      What seperates Messi from the rest is his quick change of direction. His
      ability to twist and turn his body, come to a quick stop during max sprints, and
      accelerate to top speed in a short time makes messi a nightmare to defend
      against. To make things worse, he is one of the few palyers in history able
      to keep the ball "glued" to his feet, even at a full sprint. His abilities
      allow him to take on multiple defenders with ease and high efficiency rates.

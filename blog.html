      <h2>Who is Lionel Messi?</h2>
      <p>
         Messi, born and raised in Argentina, displayed
         innate talent for playing football early on. Messi
         began his footballing career when he was only 8 years
         old with a local soccer club named <a href="https://www.newellsoldboys.com.ar">
         Newell's Old Boys</a>.
         He continued to play with Newell's old boys for 5 years, quickly
         ascending the ranks, and enventually getting noticed by top
         soccer clubs. He eventually got recruited in the year 2000, at the
         age of 13 years, by <a href="https://www.fcbarcelona.com/">FC Barcelona</a>; one of the worlds best soccer
         clubs at that time and still to this day. Messi thus continued his
         footballing career overseas in Spain.
      </p>

      <p>
        Messi joined Barca's under 14s academy and began progressing through
        Barcelona's ranks at an astonishing rate, Climbing thought Barca C,
        Barca B, and the first team in record time. He made his first
        team debut in a friendly match at the age of 16! He appeared in his
        first official match when he was 17 years old and became a rugular
        feature of Barca's first team squad afterwards.

      <h2>Physical Struggles</h2>
      <p>
        Born with what seems to be god given football skills, messi had a
        growth defect during his early career. Messi was shorter and weaker
        than the rest of the players around him, but what he lacked in
        physicality he made up in pure raw talent. Tought treatment was
        available, it would cost upwards of $900 per month for 2 years, a cost
        that he couldn't afford. It wasn't until Barcelona recruited him
        that he underwent growth hormone treatment. Barcelona took
        a gamble on him by investing so much money on Messi, but in retrospect
        it was definatly worth it.

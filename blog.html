      <h2 class="title">Who is Lionel Messi?</h2>
      <div>
        <p>Messi, born and raised in Argentina, displayed innate talent for
          playing football early on. Messi began his footballing career when
          he was only 8 years old with a local soccer club named
          <a href="https://www.newellsoldboys.com.ar">Newell's Old Boys</a>.
          He continued to play with Newell's old boys for 5 years, quickly
          ascending the ranks, and enventually getting noticed by top soccer
          clubs. He eventually got recruited in the year 2000, at the age of
          13 years, by <a href="https://www.fcbarcelona.com/">FC Barcelona</a>;
          one of the worlds best soccer clubs at that time and still to this
          day. Messi thus continued his footballing career overseas in Spain.
        </p>

        <p>Messi joined Barca's under 14s academy and began progressing through
          Barcelona's ranks at an astonishing rate, Climbing thought Barca C,
          Barca B, and the first team in record time. He made his first
          team debut in a friendly match at the age of 16! He appeared in his
          first official match when he was 17 years old and became a rugular
          feature of Barca's first team squad afterwards.

      <h2 class="title">Physical Struggles</h2>
      <div>
        <p>Born with what seems to be god given football skills, messi had a
        growth defect during his early career. Messi was shorter and weaker
        than the rest of the players around him, but what he lacked in
        physicality he made up in pure raw talent. Tought treatment was
        available, it would cost upwards of $900 per month for 2 years, a cost
        that he couldn't afford. It wasn't until Barcelona recruited him
        that he underwent growth hormone treatment. Barcelona took
        a gamble on him by investing so much money on Messi, but in retrospect
        it was definatly worth it.

      <h2 class="title">Shooting Accuracy</h2>
      <div>
        <p>Messi's average shot attempt has a .182 chance of being goal, making
        him the 9th most efficient shooter in the sport. However, when taking
        shot volume into consideration, he is the top most efficient
        shooter of anyone with a similar shot volume to goal ratio.

      <div class="arguments">
        <p>
          Messi is proficient at short and long passes. Coming from FC Barcelona's
          academy, it comes to no suprise that he is superb at one touch passing
          due to Barcelona's tiki-taka style of play. What many people over look
          is his long passes and vision. He is able to make a pass where one
          doesn't seem to exist or impossible to make. Some people even say that
          he has eye's behind his head or a sixth sense.

          Thanks to his speed, Messi is able to shake off defenders with ease.
          He is able to accelarate to 19.3 mph in 2.3 seconds while dribbling.
          Messi makes use of this ability by decelerating and quickly
          accelarating during a dribble to leave oponents behind.

          Messi made himself into the world's most dangerous free kick takers.
          He was not always good at free kicks, but over the past couple of years
          he has proved himself to be among the top. He scores about 8% of the
          time, compared to all player's average of 5%.

          Messi doesn't dive like most players and continues to play even when

      <div class="arguments">
        <p class="arguments">
          What seperates Messi from the rest is his quick change of direction. His
          ability to twist and turn his body, come to a quick stop during max sprints, and
          accelerate to top speed in a short time makes messi a nightmare to defend
          against. To make things worse, he is one of the few palyers in history able
          to keep the ball "glued" to his feet, even at a full sprint. His abilities
          allow him to take on multiple defenders with ease and high efficiency rates.
